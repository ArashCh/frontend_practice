        "content": "Computer programming is the process of performing a \
        particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific \
            computing result), usually by designing and building an executable \
            computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, \
            generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource \
            consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen \
            programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] \
            The source code of a program is written in one or more languages \
            that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, \
            which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The \
            purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that \
            will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex \
            as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a \
            given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires \
            expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge \
            of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.",
